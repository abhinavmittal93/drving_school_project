                        These classes not only explain what you are going to do in the practical classes, also review the traffic signs and regulations of the law. When the course is nearing completion, schools provide support material for you to prepare for the exams you must
                        pass to get your license.

                        The first thing they teach you in a driving school is to sit porperly when driving. Although it sounds incredible, most people donâ€™t know how to sit correctly to drive; moreover, you must align mirrors according to your posture in order to eliminate dangerous
                        blind spots.

                        In a driving school you will not only be taught how to get around in a vehicle, you will be taught to drive with conscience, because they emphasize the importance of safety, respect
